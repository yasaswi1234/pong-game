# pong-game
Pong is a simple and classic game in which  two players use paddles to hit a ball back and forth across a  screen. The objective is to score points by getting the ball  past the other player's paddle and into their goal area. The  game ends when one player reaches a certain number of  points, and the winner is the player with the most points.

# pong-game
Pong is one of the most famous arcade games, simulating table tennis. Each player controls a paddle in the game by dragging it vertically across thewhole screenâ€™s left or right side. Players use their paddles to strike back and forth on the ball. Turtle is an inbuilt graphic module in Python. It uses a panel and pen to depict illustrations. In this project, we can control the paddles, hit the ball and also view the scoreboard. Once the ball hits 
the wall the game will automatically re begin until some score.
